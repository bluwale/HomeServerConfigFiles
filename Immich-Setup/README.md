Immich works inisde a container, where it will automatically upload, organize and index photos from any of my devices that are connected. It can also handle google photo exports and merge them into the db that ive hosted on my server. Db is Postgres with a redis cache that were very easy to setp thanks to Immich's docs. the docker-compose routes the ports, initializes db names, images and brings forth the .env variables to validate.
